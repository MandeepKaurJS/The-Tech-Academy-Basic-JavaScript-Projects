Hello this my file which will show version control with jenkins

jenkins CI/CD workflow implementation with real-time project

We need to connect with our version control e.g github or any source control and then configure this job with jenkins for compile using poll SCM in jenkins .
2.Compile
CI/CD starts from Code review after pulling source code from github. goals should be same like it's compile only. 
3.Code Review
step 3rd for CI/Cd is code review where we are going to syntax check of our entire project.in order to do this 
we should set PMD by using -P metrics pmd:pmd(programmer mistake detector)
need to install PMD plugin to do that.

4.Unit Test
the entire code report generate in this step. Entire project strength will be check and we need 
junit plugin for this step and need surefiles/tar.xml.
5.Matrics Check
each module strength is going to check one by one in this step call matrics check.we need 
coberture plugins for this 
need goal cobertura:cobertura -Dcobertura.report.format=xml

6.after finishing all the 5 steps we need to wrap our project into a package in the form of war. or tar file. 

set the goal as package for this step we don't need any plugin for this.
after this schedule tasks accordingly in build triggers,
schedule after project and build periodically .


7.Deployement 
need plugin called deploy to container to container.

1.we need to launch new instance for this called AMI linux and tomcat. 
and install java syntax yum install java-1.8* -y
install apache tomcat latest version
get the tar.gz link from tomcatapache officail website under tomcat in core and copy the link and install it in tmp folder. 
2. after installing tomcat copy it to under opt folder using this command:
cp -r filename which has tar.gz /opt/ go to opt folder cd /opt/
and untar the file using tar -xvzf(meaning extract vross forcefully) name apcahe .
3. then we need to start the pache server to apcahe sing cd name of apcahe and move to bin 
directory cd bin/ and do command ./startup.sh and need a service that is called catalina.sh
in order to start service of tomcat than used :cat catalina.sh 
4. to see te server we should allow the security server Go to ec2 tomcat instance click on secuirty 
group click on inbound and add new rules which allow your port to access by choosing custome tcp
and putt ur port under port range. now we need username and password in order to deploy an
application on tomcat server.
5. then go to under bin file called conf. by using cd ../conf/ command under this we have 
file called server.xml and open this file by using vim server.xml and under this file
serch for connector option in order to connect by ur own port number. 
port range is usually from 0 to 65535 and give ur port number as u want and save it suing :wq!
and then shutdown tomcat server by go back to ur bin directory using ./shutdown.sh and restart
after all these stepscreate username and pswd.
6. do cat server.xml |grep connector
use context.xml command for uname n pwd :we should commment default values 
find / -name context.xml to see manager app n other aaps
choose /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.56/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml this file to chane value
inside context comment the only value part and save.
and then open the manager file by using this /opt/apache-tomcat-8.5.56/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
and comment the same value as we did in last file.
7.
now set the usename and pswd under tomcat-users.xml file by using vim tomcat-users.xml
we should set the role name under this file by uncommenting roles and set role name 
manager-gui and another one is manager-script and give username as you want and pswd and set roles
manager-gui and manager-script then login with those credentials.
example :  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
 <role rolename="manager-script"/>
 <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
 <role rolename="manager-status"/>
 <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status"/>
 <user username="deployer" password="deployer" roles="manager-script"/>
 <user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager-gui"/> 
8.
Now ready to deploy your project under tomcat server and create new job in jenkins in order to do that.
and set the goals for it called package. how to push our war file on tomcat server we need 
plugins called deploy to container.after installing plugins go to poast build choose deploy war to container
and give the default path for war file by */**.war this and then give the context path relavant to project
name like addressbook and then add the container by clicking on add container by choosing tomcat8
and then add your tomcat server credentials username tomcat and password by clicking on add button.
9. next step is adding tomcat url: give your local url like: http://18.216.137.3:1030/urprojectname
eg. http://18.216.137.3:1030/addressbook/ and open this projectunder tomcat then u willget the output 
of your project and your war file is push to tomcat server. it's deploy on tomcat server.
10.
your war file should be under apache server under webapps.
